        cardDetailedText: "I worked at Cafe Republica for one year (from 2018 to 2019) gaining experience and I fell in love with Specialty Coffee. Then I decided to open my own caf√©, where I could improve a lot of skills I already had, such as organization, management, finances, problem-solving, etc. I had to deal with a lot of different situations and had daily contact with clients and suppliers. I could grow a lot, both personally and professionally, with this huge experience, but the time came where I realized this cycle had come to an end and change careers.",
