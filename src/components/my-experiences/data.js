There I did a little bit of everything, focusing on the management and customer experience, attending 50-100 clients a day. Dealing with clients and undesrtanding their needs is something I really like and was already used to from my previous experiences. I could improve a lot of other skills I already had, such as organization, management, finances, problem-solving, and I grew up a lot both personally and professionally with this experience.",

In that area I had constant contact with both inside and outside customers. I was responsible for the customer support when needed to activate the cargo insurance, that part was very delicate because I had to bring the bad news about the damaged cargo, so it required a good communication skill and empathy. I had to deal with problem solving and monthly reports. Since I had to manage two areas at the same time, I could improve abilities such as time management, organization, process optimization, and so on."
