I am graduated in International Business and now I am studying System Development and Analysis. I have worked for 5 years in a logistics and transport company in diffrent areas, being able to improve a lot of skills. Afterwards I opened my own caf√© in Porto Alegre, where I worked with Specialty coffee, it was an enriching experience where I could develop my communication skills, problem-solving, time management, etc. I am an active person, for my hobbies I like swimming, going out for a run, reading and  I also love travelling. I'm a curious person and I have been studying frontend and backend languages to improve my skills and knowledge in the area. I have already finished some courses and I'm constantly studying to practice and get better and better. I'm looking forward to collaborating on a company that I identify with and be able to grow professionally in this area that I like so much."
