I am graduated in International Business at Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (UNISINOS), and I worked for 5 years in a logistics and transport company, called Kuehne+Nagel. Afterwards I opened my own caf√© in Porto Alegre, coffee is also a great passion I have, but it came to a point where I realized that cycle had come to an end and so I decided to change careers. I'm a curious person and currently studying frontend and backend languages to improve my skills and knowledge in the area. I'm looking forward to collaborating on a company that I identify with and be able to grow professionally in this area that I like so much."
